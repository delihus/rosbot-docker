# rosbot-docker
Docker Image for ROS Melodic Node providing interface for STM32 firmware over ROS-serial.

`rosbot-docker` contain following ROS packages:
- [rosbot_description](https://github.com/husarion/rosbot_description)
- [rosbot_ekf](https://github.com/husarion/rosbot_ekf)

With *docker-compose* configuration shown in [examples](./examples) it can communicate with hardware of both Rosbot 2.0 and Rosbot 2.0 Pro.

## Flashing firmware | switch kinematics

Firmware if flashed from inside of container. In order to use specific kinematics flash matching firmware.

For differential drive flash firmware with:
``` bash
cd examples/rosbot_flash_firmware_diff
docker-compose up
 ```

 For mecanum kinematics flash firmware with:

``` bash
cd examples/rosbot_flash_firmware_mecanum
docker-compose up
 ```

## Building

 ``` bash
docker buildx build \
--platform linux/amd64 \
-t rosbot-docker-test \
.
 ```

## Configuring Orbbec Astra

In *docker-compose.yaml* you have to change `device` passed to docker. For more information refer to `astra-docker` [README.md](https://github.com/husarion/astra-docker)
